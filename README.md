# Vedic_multiplier
The project designs an 8-bit Vedic multiplier using Verilog HDL, employing Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra for efficient partial product generation. This design aims to achieve faster, low-power multiplication with reduced area, and is simulated and synthesized in Xilinx ISE for performance evaluation.
